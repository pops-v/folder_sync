# folder_sync 

Usage:

python script_name.py "path to source folder" "path to replica folder" "path to log file" synchronization_interval


Usage example: 
python folder_sync.py "C:\Users\pops\Desktop\folder_sync\source" "C:\Users\pops\Desktop\folder_sync\replica" "C:\Users\pops\Desktop\folder_sync\logs"  5


Make sure all paths exist, especially the source folder. The script will create the replica folder and the log file if they donâ€™t exist.

The script will keep synchronizing every synchronization_interval seconds until you stop it (Ctrl+C on most systems).

Both the console and the log file will show messages about file creation, updates, and removals during synchronization.
